DEBuild (Develop Environment Build) this project idea was came out when I try to build up my linux OS on VirtualBox. It help to build up all tools and environment automatically, before you start your develop job.<br>

__Also made myself get familiar with Shell Script & Makefile langurages.__

I know that name "DEB" will let you little bit confuse with Linux package format ".deb". But... too late! I'm lazy to change it lol!!! ðŸ˜¬

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

__Warning:__ _DEBuild now only works on Debain-based Linux.(It will be support Fedora-based & MacOS lately)_

* You don't have to install anything before launch this tool.
* Set up package settings at `src/config` file before launch this tool.
* Make sure your terminal `cd` to `DEBuild` path.
* Type `sudo ./DEBuild_linux.sh` to launch it.

## Packages supported

__DEBuild now release as Beta version.__
In Beta version, I focus on program structure like program working flow, bugs ...etc. Now only support few packages. I will fill in more packages installation soon in near future.

_These packages all possible to turn off by modify `src/config` file._
* Git
* C develop environment (build-essential)
* Several C libraries
* Sublime IDE (Stable/Development version)
